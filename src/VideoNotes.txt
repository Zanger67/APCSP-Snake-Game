Start Screen:
This page displays the top 10 high scores recorded in a TXT file. 
This is taken via a BufferedReader system.

Game Screen:
The game's parameters are set in a parameter file, containing the specifics for all colors (such as the snake's head, snake's body, apple, and background colors), time between frames, board size, etc.

Inputs for the game are mapped to WSAD and Arrow keys and display in the console which direction the snake is heading (i.e. l = left, r = right, etc.). 


High Score Screen:
If the player achieves a high score (score = number of apples * 100), then they will be prompted for their name for it to be added to the high scores file.

FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES, THE NAME #BOB WILL BE USED.


For Scoring:
======
Inputs: Keyboard input (direction of snake); User input of name on high score page (text box); file input and reading (high scores and game parameters).

Lists: Matrix used for game map, recording snake position, apple position, etc.; ArrayLists for high score readings; label arrays for creating a multi-font and multi-sized set of text for certain JFrames.

Procedures: All procedures are explained in the code's comments on the PDF.

Algorithm: Selection of a new apple's position; calculation of snake's new position; adding of snake's length after eating an apple.

Output: visual outputs via Java Graphics and JFrame text components.
